This is a web application built without starter code that acts as a professional web development portfolio. The purpose of this web application is to showcase deployed web projects for prospective employers.

## Description

 This web application applies recently learned skills and technologies such as CSS animation and Bootstrap. Some animation was added to elements which will appear on a desktop when hovering with a mouse and when the page loads on all devices. All links function and take the user to the indicated location.
